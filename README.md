### shared-worker

Very simple app to test using the [SharedWorker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) and Websockets to send over "user analytics" to a backend with a single Kafka Producer. [Example backend here](https://github.com/BadassHenkka/fastapi-kafka-producer).
